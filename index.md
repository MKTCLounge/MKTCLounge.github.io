I. JOINING THE LOUNGE

A. Upon joining the server, users send their MKCentral Registry account in the #mkcentral-links channel in our Discord Server. For help doing this, refer to this guide.
Ex. https://www.mariokartcentral.com/forums/index.php?members/luismx.6179/

i. New and returning players will need to use the !verify command to validate their MKCentral account. Using the following command:
!verify LoungeName https://www.mariokartcentral.com/forums/index.php?members/MKCentralMemberId

ii. LoungeName is the name you will use in this discord server Lounge, do not use special characters other than '-._' and maximum one space character. If you are a returning player, please put you previous lounge name.

iii. MKCentralMemberId is the ID you receive upon registration to MKCentral site (Note: member ID ≠ player ID).

B. Making an alternate account to join lounge will result in a ban from lounge, and an MKCentral ban of at least 2 months. MKCentral Staff will find out if an alternate account is made, so it's highly recommended to not do so.


II. NAMES

A. If you would like a specific nickname for the scoreboard and Discord server, you can ask for that too. If you already have a rank and would like to change your name, this request can be made in #name-change-requests channel. You will have to use !rename newLoungeName command.

i. Nicknames may only contain letters (at least one), numbers, spaces, periods/full stops, hyphen or underscores. They must start and end with only letters or numbers, and must have 20 characters maximum. They also may not contain any vulgar language or impersonate another MKC user. In most cases, if your name can be used as a Twitter username, you can use it in lounge. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis.​

B. Every player is allowed to request nickname changes, but after one request they need to wait 60 days to request another name change. They may request to change back to their previous Registry name at any time though, but they will still be unable to make further name change requests for 60 days.

C. Player who received Reporter Banned role are unable to request name changes.

D. A nickname request may be denied upon staff reviewal.
