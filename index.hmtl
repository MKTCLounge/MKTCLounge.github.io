MKTC Lounge Rules

I. JOINING THE LOUNGE

A. Upon joining the server, users send their MKCentral Registry account in the #mkcentral-links channel in our Discord Server. For help doing this, refer to this guide.

Ex. https://www.mariokartcentral.com/forums/index.php?members/luismx.6179/

i. New and returning players will need to use the /verify command to validate their MKCentral account. Using the following command: /verify LoungeName https://www.mariokartcentral.com/forums/index.php?members/MKCentralMemberId

ii. LoungeName is the name you will use in this discord server Lounge, do not use special characters other than '-._' and maximum one space character. If you are a returning player, please put you previous lounge name.

iii. MKCentralMemberId is the ID you receive upon registration to MKCentral site (Note: member ID ≠ player ID).

B. If you would like a specific nickname for the scoreboard and Discord server, you can ask for that too. If you already have a rank and would like to change your name, this request can be made in #name-change-requests channel. You will have to use /rename newLoungeName command. Names can be changed ONCE during the current season. You can change back to your Registry name at any time, but you will still be unable to make further name change requests.

i. Nicknames may only contain letters (at least one), numbers, spaces, periods/full stops, hyphen or underscores. They must start and end with only letters or numbers, and must have 20 characters maximum. They also may not contain any vulgar language or impersonate another MKC user. In most cases, if your name can be used as a Twitter username, you can use it in lounge. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis.

ii. Every player is allowed to request nickname changes, but after one request they need to wait 90 days to request another name change. They may request to change back to their previous Registry name at any time though, but they will still be unable to make further name change requests for 90 days.

iii. Player who received Reporter Banned role are unable to request name changes.

iv. A nickname request may be denied upon staff reviewal.

c. Making an alternate account to join lounge will result in a permanent ban from lounge, and an MKCentral ban of at least 6 months. MKCentral Staff will find out if an alternate account is made, so it's highly recommended to not do so.

II. RANKING SYSTEM

A. Once a staff member has seen your account, you will be placed into one of the following ranks.

i. Everyone starts off at 750 MMR (Iron), but existing players will start at a Placement MMR.

ii. These are all the ranks:

Iron: 0-999 MMR Bronze: 1000-1999 MMR (Placement: 1500 MMR) Silver: 2000-2999 MMR (Placement: 2500 MMR) Gold: 3000-3999 MMR (Placement: 3500 MMR) Platinum: 4000-4999 MMR Ruby: 5000-5999 MMR Diamond: 6000-6999 MMR Master: 7000-7999 MMR Grandmaster: 8000+ MMR

Tier E: Iron + Bronze Tier D: Bronze + Silver Tier C: Silver + Gold Tier B: Gold + Platinum Tier A: Platinum + Ruby + Diamond + Master + Grandmaster Tier S: Ruby + Diamond + Master + Grandmaster Tier X: Diamond + Master + Grandmaster

III. GATHERING LINEUPS

A. Using MogiBot, the first eight players to say "/can" or "/c" will play. Any players later than 8th on the list will be subs, given priority by their order on the list. Players in the waiting list that are unable to sub when needed will receive a -50 MMR strike.

B. The next player in the MogiBot lineup will always have priority when subbing into an event. If a different player subs in when the next player in the MogiBot lineup is able to play, the player will receive -50 MMR strike.

C. A "/c or /can" will automatically expire after 25 minutes have passed. A list of players can be found using "/list".

i. If a team can find a sub for a missing player before the late penalty time, the missing player will not receive the SQ restricted role.

C. Subs are allowed in Squad Queue events; however, the sub's MMR must keep their team's average MMR within the range of the room. In other words, if a team would be in a different room if their team MMR was different, then the sub isn't allowed.

i. If a team gets a sub which would put their average MMR in a different room, the whole team will receive -50 and a strike at minimum. If the team wins more than 50 MMR, the penalty will be increased to match the amount of MMR they would have gained.

A. Unranked is a game mode where you don’t lose any MMR and just play for fun, which is enable for all ranks.

B. In accordance with these official rules, the same rules will apply for unranked.

i. In case of receiving a penalty. The strike will be applied without receiving MMR loss. ii. It will not be considered trolling by allowing all drivers to be used with their respective abilities incluiding item+ (refer to rule VII.b.i).
